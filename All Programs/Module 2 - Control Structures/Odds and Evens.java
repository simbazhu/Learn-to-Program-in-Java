// For this project you are going to program a game called "Odds and Evens". The game is similar
// to rock paper scissors. It is played between two players, in your version it will be you versus the
// computer. Each player will choose either "odds" or "evens", since youâ€™re playing the computer
// you will get first pick. Once you have chosen your side, you each choose a number of fingers to
// play- 0 to 5. The winner is determined by whether the sum of your fingers is odd or even
// (depending on what you chose).
